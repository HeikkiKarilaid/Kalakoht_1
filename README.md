This is my very first javascript project. It's a web app for me and my friends for sharing cool camping and fishing places. I started a javascript course in may and finished it in little over a month. This so far is the work of 40-50 hours. The code is a mess, but it mostly works :) It's a work in progress still. Considering I started from zero I'm pretty happy with the result so far, definetly learned a lot. I can honestly say that I've never felt more stupid than during building this thing.I spent hours and hours tinkering with some problem but the strange thing is that I never got tired of it or really frustrated. And when I finally solved a problem, that felt really good :).

I used firebase authentication, realtime database and storage. A user can add a location on the map and the app stores the location in the database with a photo if a user takes it. It's possible to add a comment also. When signing in, the app takes all the locations from the database and displays them on the map.

The app is also live at https://kalakoht-d1ba4.web.app
